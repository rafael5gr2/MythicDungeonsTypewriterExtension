To compile the extension, create a directory called libs and place the MythicDungeons plugin in it. Ensure that the plugin's jar file is named MythicDungeons.jar, and that you are using version 2 of the plugin, which is currently under development. This is a temporary solution, as the MythicDungeons Maven repository does not yet include the v2 API.
